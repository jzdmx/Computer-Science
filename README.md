# Computer-Science
The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between algorithm structure and algorithm time complexity. 
Algorithm time complexity is a measure of the time it takes to complete an algorithm with a given input, and the running time depends on the algorithm itself and the quality of the computer's hardware. In addition, the BIG O notation is introduced in order to analyse the structure of the algorithm. 
The execution time of each method is plotted to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm and the best algorithm is obtained.
